# Sentiment-Analysis-Project
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sentiments from text data using machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to classify text into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. We employ several models including Passive Aggressive Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes for sentiment classification.The modeling phase revealed that the Passive Aggressive Classifier was the best-performing model for this sentiment analysis task. The hyperparameter tuning further enhanced its accuracy. The insights from the model evaluations and visualizations provided a comprehensive understanding of the text data's sentiment distribution, supporting the overall goal of accurately classifying sentiments in text data.
